## Usage
![home page](./images/ss1.PNG)

This is the home page of the application. Click on get started to start taking notes

![note page](./images/ss2.PNG)

This is the note page of the application. Users can input their note title and text into the body. With the disk icon on the top right, it lets you save your notes. The plus icon lets you start a new note. The trash can icon next to the saved notes will delete your note

This is just the basic for making a server. There were two HTML pages I had to link to the server.

The first part of this back end project was making the get method to read the database.

Then I got started with the post method. This allows users to have everything they wrote into the database. First we read the files, then we pushed the data to the database and wrote the files to the database. We made a response to end the request.

This step was almost similar to our post method. Instead of pushing in the data, we used the filter method. Then we write file to rewrite what we want deleted.

These are all the responses that are being relayed back to us from the application to the server.

Github link to project : https://github.com/thandyn/Note-Taker

Due to Heroku not being available to us. We could not deploy the application. Therefore there is no link to application.
